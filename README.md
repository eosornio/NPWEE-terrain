# READ ME FILE

This repository will be used for our project, Terrain Identification using Motion Pattern Recognition, with NASA L'SPACE Academy. Keep in mind that the ipynb is only a notebook that discusses the options we can use for the software and AI portion of our project. As this is only at the conceptual phase, we will not have code here. If this project continues after Summer of 2022, we will make this repository private. This repository is documented on our New Technology Report which has been submitted. Check our NTR for forms of contact if you wish to hear more on the subject.
